## Sumbmitting a new version

Dear CRAN Maintainers,

I am delighted to submit the latest version of bdc for your consideration.

Please find the results of GitHub actions checks and rhub copied below. I am pleased to report that there were no errors detected during these tests.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards,
Bruno R. Ribeiro


## GITHUB ACTIONS CHECK

❯ checking package dependencies ... NOTE
  Imports includes 21 non-default packages.
  Importing from so many packages makes the package vulnerable to any of
  them becoming unavailable.  Move as many as possible to Suggests and
  use conditionally.
